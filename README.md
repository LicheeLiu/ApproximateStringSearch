All python programs should be compiled with python3.

Please put "dictionary.txt", "misspelled.txt" and "correct.txt" in the same directory as the python programs,
or add the directory location into python scripts.

The output of all programs will be a csv file and/or a txt file saved in the same directory as the python program.
